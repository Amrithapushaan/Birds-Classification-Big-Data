All the jumps were made facing one direction only. No other male or female Florican was observed in its vicinity. The Florican emitted the typical rapid clapping type sound ( 0:09 ) near the uppermost part of the jump trajectory.

It is found in South Asia, China, and Southeast Asia. It forms a superspecies with the closely related Black-billed and Pacific Koels which are sometimes treated as subspecies. The Asian Koel is a brood parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of crows and other hosts, who raise its young. They are unusual among the cuckoos in being largely frugivorous as adults. The name koel is echoic in origin with several language variants. The Asian Koel is a large, long-tailed, cuckoo measuring 39–46 cm (15–18 in) and weighing 190–327 g (6.7–11.5 oz). The male of the nominate race is glossy bluish-black, with a pale greenish grey bill, the iris is crimson, and it has grey legs and feet. The female of the nominate race is brownish on the crown and has rufous streaks on the head. The back, rump and wing coverts are dark brown with white and buff spots. The underparts are whitish, but is heavily striped. The other subspecies differ in colouration and size. The upper plumage of young birds is more like that of the male and they have a black beak. They are very vocal during the breeding season (March to August in South Asia), with a range of different calls. The familiar song of the male is a repeated koo-Ooo. The female makes a shrill kik-kik-kik... call. Calls vary across populations. The Asian Koel is a bird of light woodland and cultivation. It is a mainly resident breeder in tropical southern Asia from India and Sri Lanka to south China and the Greater Sundas. They have great potential in colonizing new areas, and were among the pioneer birds to colonize the volcanic island of Krakatau. They first arrived in Singapore in the 1980s and became very common birds. Some populations may make long distance movements.",no

This was the first time I had seen this bird. It was sitting on a tree which was nearly 10 feet away from me and the bird was sitting on a branch that was nearly 20 feet high. The habitat was moist deciduous patch of a forest.

The bird I spotted was male. I checked from Grimmett-Inskipp (my field guide) and recognized it by this peculiar pattern of white bands on its undertail coverts. I knew it was some kind of cuckoo due to the type of repetitive calls it made. Rest of the body was grey. Ventral plumage was light grey and dorsal plumage was dark grey.

The bird was simply sitting on a branch and calling regularly in the notes - pee-pipee-pipee...

Habitat: In general, a degraded scrub jungle. Three birds were perched on an electric pole inside the scrub jungle.
Other Notes: The three birds were making intermittent sallies, and were making these calls even in flight. All the three were not perching at the same time, when one comes to perch it displaces another one, who then goes for a sally and then comes and displaces another one. One of the birds also caught an Odonate in mid air.",yes

It cold around 22-23 degree during this early monsoon season in Pune.

There was approx 3 birds, responding to each others calls staying at a distance of approx 100-200 meters.

I couldn't see any of them, but recorded one of their sound.

In this clip, the bird sings for 3 times, approx 4 syllables in lower pitch and 4 syllables in higher pitch, both completed within 3-4 seconds. Then a stop of approx 7-10 seconds, then again continue.

The underparts and lower back are a warm tawny-brown to orange-brown in colour with white wing coverts and black primaries. The bill, legs and feet are black.

The rufous treepie is an arboreal omnivore feeding almost completely in trees on fruits, seeds, invertebrates, small reptiles and the eggs and young of birds; it has also been known to take flesh from recently killed carcasses. It is an agile forager, clinging and clambering through the branches and sometimes joining mixed hunting parties along with species such as drongos and babblers. It has been observed feeding on ecto-parasites of wild deer. Like many other corvids they are known to cache food. They have been considered to be beneficial to palm cultivation in southern India due to their foraging on the grubs of the destructive weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus. They are known to feed on the fruits of Trichosanthes palmata which are toxic to mammals.",yes

They are widely distributed along the foothills of the Himalayas in South Asia and extending into Indo-china, southern mainland China and Taiwan. The populations vary in plumage and several are named as subspecies.
Grey Treepies are omnivorous birds mostly thriving among dense foliage and in forests. They sometimes take part in mixed species flocks with laughingthrushes, especially the White-throated. Systematically together working through the hill forests and other trees, especially in the mornings.
It is the same size as other Dendrocitta species and is separated from them by the overall grey colour of the body. White rump and a black tail. The face and throat are dark and black with a diffuse mask. The body is grey on the underside becoming whiter towards the vent. The back and scapulars are brownish. The crown and nape are greyish and the black wing has a prominent white carpal patch. The vent is rufous and the outer tail feathers and tips of the central feathers are black.
This treepie is mostly an arboreal feeder but will take some food from the ground especially in cultivated regions. A wide range of insects and other invertebrates are taken including berries, nectar, grain and other seeds and also small reptiles, eggs and nestlings.",yes

Additional notes: Upon playing this call back to the bird, AFTER this recording was made, the bird immediately entered into a form of flight dislplay, uttering a more musical song and creating what were presumably sounds from wing/tail vibration made halfway through its relatively short (3-5m) and almost direct flights from one rock to the next. I say almost direct because the bird did gain a little elevation (2/3m) up until the halfway point. Most often, the bird just used the gradient of the land to flutter down to lower rocks, or to grassy cover from which it ran to a nearby rock. After a second, also brief playback, an hour later, also AFTER this recording was made, the bird did a flight display right over my head.

I have not modified the recording in any way. If anyone with the necessary skills wishes to clip or modify the recording, I'm more than happy for this to be done and would provide the original file without hesitation.",yes
